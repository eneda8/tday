                <p>t'day is the world's first collective online journal. Users rate each day and track how their days
                    are going over time. t'day aggregates all ratings so everyone can see how all we're doing as a
                    community. </p>

                <p>To create a space where everyone can be their authentic selves, we encourage complete anonymity (no

                <p>However, we do ask for broad demographic information (your <span class="font-weight-bold">age

                <p>Your country's flag is included on all posts and comments, as well as your profile. Gender and age
                    group are completely private (and cannot be changed after you sign up.)</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-0">What are journals?</p>
                <p>Journals are a <span class="font-weight-bold">private</span> place for you to write about anything at
                    all, with no character limit, separate from public t'day ratings. Journals have an additional layer
                    of AES-256-CBC encryption on top of your hashed and encrypted account password. </p>

                <p>Public or private, daily self-reflection is important for growth, individually and collectively. </p>
                <p>Let's see how we're all doing, one t'day at a time. :)</p>
